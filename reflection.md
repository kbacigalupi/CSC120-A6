- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impressions of inheritancs is that it can be really useful in creating a lot more functionality of our code in less lines of code. I think it's cool the wide variety of buildings we were able to create a lot more quickly than if we had to create each class individually with the same attributes. I think it will be much more interesting when we extend the assignment and are able to use all of the building methods on all of the child class instances.

The difficult part about this assignment because there were so many pieces to get through. Each individual step did not take very much time-the entire thing did not take a super long time. However, even though each method and extension wasn't very much work, there were a lot more places to make erros because each class has several individual methods. I also specifically struggled with the restock class in thinking through the logic of the class. I'm still not sure if it is doing exactly what it is supposed to be doing I also think there is a cleaner or more elegant way to print out a hashtable, but this was the only thin I could find or understand what was happening. I think next week I want to work to make the printCollection() libray more elegant.

I think it's important to go through things piece by piece. The assignment is very clearly broken down for us, and the directions and rubric are really helpful in figuring out how to approach a problem. I think it's important for people to use what is given to them.
